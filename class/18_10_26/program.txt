Take the chess board example and add the following features:
 - When clicking on a piece indicate the piece is active
     - when clicking on an other spot on the board move the activated piece to this spot
     - when clicking on the same piece instead, make it inactive again
 - ensure after moving a white piece it is blacks turn and visa verse, do not allow
   multiple turns from the same color after each other
 - ensure a piece cannot move onto another piece of the same color
 - if a piece moves onto a piece of the other color it is assumed this piece is
   beaten and removed from the game board
 - white always starts a chess game

 Bonus:
    - make a validation for each movement, that ensures,
      a piece can only move to proper places
    - indicate who's turn it is
