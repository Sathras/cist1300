        This is currently a stable map generator for the epic board game
        <a href='#'>Twilight Imperium</a> and/or <a href='#'>Shattered Ascension</a>.
        SA is an unofficial addition to the board game featuring additional rules
        and extended content. This is intended to be a high-quality archive of
        good and balanced present maps. Therefore, uploaded maps go through a
        moderation system.

        Ultimately the goal of this website is to become a playable online version of
        TI / SA and also bring more fans into the genre. It is our hope that we can
        support Fantasy Flight Games for some additional purchases because a board
        game adaption will never be as good as the real immersion of the grand sci-fi
        game!
