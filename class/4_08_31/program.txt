Assignment 1 (10 min)
    1. look for a small icon image in the interent and find out the absolute path
    2. upload the file to your repository
    3. create a HTML file with 3 links showing the same image:
        - a absolute link to the original file
        - a relative link to the file on your server
        - a absolute link to the file on your server

        ensure the image and the html file are not in the same directory
