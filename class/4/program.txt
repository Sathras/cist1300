Assignment 1 (10-15 min)
    1. look for a small image in the interent and find out the absolute path
    2. upload the file to your repository
    3. create a HTML file with 3 links showing the same image:
        - a absolute link to the original file
        - a relative link to the file on your server
        - a absolute link to the file on your server

        ensure the image and the html file are not in the same directory
        usually web developers put all image files in a folder "img"

Assignment 2 (25-30 min)
    - make a complete webpage with 4 different pages, connected via
    a menu (same menu on each page)
        - index.html
        - page1.html
        - page2.html
        - page3.html
    - separate menu from page content via 2 div blocks!
    - provide at least a heading and content on each page

    Challenge: (try making the menu a horizontal list!)
