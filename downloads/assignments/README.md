# Project ReadMe
I plan for my project to be an informative website all about [bats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat).

### Description

This website will include information so that viewers understand what bats are, different species that exist, where they live, etc. It will also include various diagrams and pictures of bats. Many of these pictures will link website visitors to other pages about specific bats. Additionally, included will also be information regarding bat conservation and links to other websites and organizations regarding bats and their conservation. Finally, I will list the urls to all of the sources that I will use to gather my information.

### Components of Website
The website will consist of five pages and will have a fixed menu bar across the top with which to navigate between pages. On this menu bar, there will also be a button that will give the viewer the option to share the website on Facebook.

 - The first page will be the home page. It will contain a title section, multiple images, and paragraphs/lists of information.
 - The second page will be a general information page. This page will give more specific facts and will contain a title section, multiple sections of text, and images.
 - The third page will be a picture gallery. It will contain a title section and a table of images. These images will be of various species/types of bats, and each image (when clicked) will link to the Wikipedia page for that specific variety of bat.
 - The fourth page will be an informative page about conservation. It will include paragraphs about conservation, links to websites where the viewer can help with conservation efforts, and images of these efforts in action.
 - The fifth page is simply a page where I will list links to my information sources.
