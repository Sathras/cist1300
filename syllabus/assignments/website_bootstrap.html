<p>The students will implement the project suggested in the project readMe using
Bootstrap. JavaScript and JQuery are allowed for this project.
To make it more challenging no custom CSS is allowed in this project.
You wont not need it for a basic bootstrap website.<br>
You shall be encouraged to try out as many elements Boostrap provides,
however think about how you integrate them into your page so it fits.</p>
<p>The students will be graded based on the following rubric:</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <p>The Assignment is to program a bootstrap page using the starter code I provide the public
  Cloud9 Repository under <strong>/downloads/bootstrap_assignment/</strong><br>
  Alternatively you can download the code as a ZIP file here: <a href='../downloads/bootstrap_assignment.zip' target='_blank'>Download ZIP FIle</a></p>
  <p>This starting code contains the basic HTML structure and already the Bootstrap Navigation Bar.</p>
</div>
<p class='lead'>There are 2 additional tasks that I want you to do:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find 3 pictures larger or equal to 900x300 pixels, and crop them down to 900x300 pixels. You can use Paint, Photoshop or even Cloud9 for this.<br>
  Change your carousel so that the new images are displayed and you can slide though the pictures.</li>
  <li>If the screensize gets small (mobile view), hide the 3 panels and instead show an Accordon Element
  (Colapse in Bootstrap), containing the same content the 3 original panels had.</li>
</ol>
