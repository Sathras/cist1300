<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Info: </strong><a href='https://c9.io' target='_blank'>Cloud9</a> is a browser-based IDE (development environment) that we will use for all coding activities (except the tutorials, which come with their own interactive solution).
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Specifically we will use each <strong>student's private workspace (assignments)</strong> for individual assignment submissions</li>
  <li>Specifically we will use the <strong>instructor's public workspace (cist1300)</strong> for class materials</li>
  <li>Specifically we will use the <strong>instructor's public workspace (cist1300-class)</strong> for: in-class participation</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Cloud9 as an IDE comes with several advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students can follow the instructor in class while looking at their own screens. This works like Google Docs and code is updated in real-time. This way students in the last rows will be able to see what the instructor is typing.</li>
  <li>Cloud9 has a file history system built in and you can easily go back in time and see change after change.</li>
  <li>Cloud9 has a strong color highlighting built in. This makes code much more readable.</li>
  <li>There are countless other advantages you will explore and recognize during the semester.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your Student ID number</h4>
<p>
  Each student has been assigned a random ID number (that can be found in blackboard under "grades". This number will determine your accounts username and name.
  <i>Example: your ID number is 9. Your username will be cist209.</i>
