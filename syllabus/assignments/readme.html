<p>Every Development Project should have a ReadMe. The purpose is to describe the project and provide important related information like contributors, external sources and more.</p>

<p>In this exercise the students will have to write a brief readme.md file using the mark-down language.</p>

<p>The readme.md file should be placed in the root of the student's private workspace and should be named README.md. You can replace the content of the sample readme.md that is always present in a new cloud9 workspace.</p>
The description of your website topic should be sharp - that means short but very precicely capturing the content of your website.

  <p><strong>Idea:</strong> It is probably helpful to look at the grading rubric for the three implementations of the website, to see if the intended project topic is actually suiteable for all website assignments. Keep the topic very basic and specific and you will avoid problems and extra effort later!</p>
