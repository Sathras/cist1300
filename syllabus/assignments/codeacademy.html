<h4>1. Sign Up at Cloud9</h4>
<ol>
  <li>You have gotten an email that looks like this:<br />
    <blockquote>
      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p>You've been invited to develop software with cist1300 on Cloud9. Click the following link to accept the invitation: https://c9.io/team/invite/9cE5r5mGh4dsK20SwEjV</p>
      <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>Cloud9 is a full-featured IDE in the cloud, combining a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu workspace.</p>              Happy coding!
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow the link and sign up for an account with the following settings:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Name: <strong>cist2xx</strong> (where xx is your id number, see above)<br />
        <strong class='text-danger'>It is very important to not use your real name here, otherwise classmates can identify you!</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Username: cist2xx (where xx is your id number, see above)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h4>2. Create your private workspace</h4>
<p>After creating the account, students have to create a new private workspace with the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Workspace name: <strong>assignments</strong></li>
  <li>Team: <strong>CIST 1300</strong></li>
  <li>Hosted Workspace security: <strong>private</strong></li>
  <li>Choose a template: <strong>HTML5</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Share it with your instructor</h4>
<p>After the workspace has been created, the following steps have to be taken:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Top Right Corner, there is a SHARE button. <i>Click it</i></li>
  <li>ensure all three <i>checkmarks</i> for public access are <strong>unchecked</strong>.</li>
  <li>Invite your instructor into the workspace by adding his username (<i>fuchsberger</i>).</li>
  <li><span>Give your instructor read and write privileges.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> by inviting your instructor into your private workspace,
  he will receive an email. If you did everything correctly the instructor will invite
  you to both his public workspaces (class and course). You have to accept both invitations.</p>
</div>

After you have completed all steps above you should be able to access:
<ul>
  <li><strong>https://ide.c9.io/fuchsberger/cist1300</strong> (Course Materials) - read only</li>
  <li><strong>https://ide.c9.io/fuchsberger/cist1300-class</strong> (Class Participation) - read/write</li>
  <li><strong>https://ide.c9.io/cist2xx/assignments</strong> (Assignments) - read/write</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p><strong>Don't let me EVER catch you sharing your private workspace (assignments) with a fellow student.</strong><br>
  This may be treated as plagiarim and remember, I can access the workspace at any time -
  including a history of people who joined / left the workspace.</p>
